# Fix experience.php and experience.js

## Issues to Fix:
1. [ ] Fix addExperience() logic in experience.js - make work experience optional with at least company OR position required
2. [ ] Fix reference bug in validateAndNext() - change ref.name to ref.reference_name
3. [ ] Fix references loading in experience.php - push objects instead of separate array elements

## Plan:
1. Edit experience.js to fix addExperience() logic
2. Edit experience.js to fix reference property name
3. Edit experience.php to fix references loading logic
